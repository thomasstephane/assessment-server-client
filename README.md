## Overview

A good front-end engineer needs to be familiar with all the ways available to get data to the client. You'll start this exercise with an unrealistically simple application that is using static data to render. Your task is to use the following techniques to get the proper data from the server to the client.

* html data attribute(s)
* script tag(s)
* url parameter(s)
* cookie(s)

You will be doing this exercise 4 times. Each time starting from the provided code base and utilizing only one of the above techniques. Take the time to note what you like and don't like about each approach and be prepared to talk about why you think one option might be better then another.

### Core

Demonstrate you have a working knowledge of all 4 ways of getting data to the client.

#### Objectives


For each of the 4 approaches:

Get the dice roles data from the server into the client in a way that allows the JavaScript to render that data into HTML.

### You Will Know You Are Done When:

You have successful transported the dice roles data via all 4 methods.

### Stretch OPTIONAL

Demonstrate you understand at least some of the trade-offs between the 4 options.

* How are they affected by caching?
* How do they affect page load time?
* Would any of them break back/forward or bookmarking?
